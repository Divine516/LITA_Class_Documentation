#### Overview of the Course Content
Data analysis makes use of some tools in analyzing data. Some of these tools include:
- Microsoft Excel
- Structured Language Query (SQL)
- Power Business Intelligence (Power BI)


Agenda
- Foundation of Data
- Introduction to Ms Excel
- Basic Excel Functions
- Reports and Dashboards in Excel
- Project Challenge


#### Foundations of Data
Before we can dive into the foundations of data, we need to know what Data Literacy means. Data Literacy is how we should perceive data and some of the difference our data should be on before we can do certain things with it or before we are able to make meaning out of the data set.

DATA GENERATION: This is an important phrase in the data life cycle. The way you generate your data, will impact some of the things you are about to do with your data afterwards. The way you handle data collection is important to the outcome of the data. However ths phase is managed is what will reflect in your data set.  Data set is a collection of data point. Example of data points include: 
1. participants name
2. Gender
3. Location of Participants
It is a collection of these points that gives birth to a data set.

Other foudations of data include: 
- Data structure
- Data storage
- Data analysis
- Statistics
- Data driven decision making.

These foundations are written in order and statistics is one of the important tool to analyze data.

It is important to note that every organization runs in 2 systems and these systems are
- Operational Systems : These system is used for execution processes. It can also be seen as a system used by organizations to manage their business process mostly on a daily basis. Some of these operational systems include; Youtube, Zoom, Oracle, Dynamics 365, SAP e.t.c These operational system are built by software developers.
- Analytic System : This system is used to evaluate business processes. Some examples of this analytic system includes ; Power BI(Self-service tool), MS excel, Tableau, Google Data Studio e.t.c

  #### Data Generation
  Everywhere you are, there is data surronding you. It is either generated on a daily or weekly basis and it starts at the grssroot level/ lowest level, from there it is sumed up and sent to the next level and finally to the highest level. It is the tools we use to execute business proceses. Data can be gathered from picturial representation or from real life situation.
   
#### Data Storage
After gathering data, it is important to store the data else there is a probability of loosing the data. There are two places where our data can be stored. How your data is stored, impacts how you will retrieve it. These two places includes;
- Premises :What this means is having your data sitting on the four walls of the organization and cannot be accessed outside the organization. It is a centralized system known as a server where other devices are connected to. Example of a premises is Ms Excel
- Cloud : The data is stored is some data centers known as cloud.It is like a warehouse that hold data where you buy spaces and you store your data there through the internet.
Examples of data sources : Ms Access, Ms excel, Postgress, SQl, Oracle, Cassandrae.t.c However an organization decides to store their data is how you will work on it.

#### Data Structure
There are three(3) different ways data is structured when you want to retrieve the data or when the data is been generated. When you have data in a perticular format, it will affect how the data is been structured.The three ways of data structure include:
- Structured data: It means your data is a tabluar format. Your mind should always go to tables when you hear of this type of data structure
- Semi-Structured data : It means it is in Jason format or XLM format not a tabular format
- Unstructured data: It comes mostly in files such as audio, video and the likes.

  If your data is structured, you will be able to analyse it but if it semi-structured or unstructured, you may not be able to analyse it. You will need to transform it to a structured data and to do that, you will make use of ETL. ETL means Extract, Transform and Load.
  - Extract: It means to connect to the data source/base so that you can pull data. After extracting you need to massage the data set. 
  - Transform: You might not always use this state. It means every thing you need to do to get your data set into the format you need. You may need to add or even remove from the data.
  - Load: This is done after the transform state.
Some of the tools used for ETL are PowerQuery, Melissa, Openrefine e.t.c


#### Data Analysis
After having your data set in the right format, the next step to take is to analyse your data. Data Analysis has a life Cycle and the cycle includes:
- Ingestion
- Transformation
- Moulding
- Visualization
- Analysis
- Presentation

  ### Why do we run analysis?
  - To help the bussiness understand which startegy is working ( before and after analysis)
  - What is not working?
  - What we should focus on.
